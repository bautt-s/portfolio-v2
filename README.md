# Bauti's Personal Portfolio
Hey! This is the repository for my personal portfolio, where I display my projects, my academic and work experience, as well as my contact links, along with some more stuff. 

## Portfolio Development
My website was developed using Next.js, along with TypeScript, Tailwind, & React. I aimed for something quick to develop, but also fast to load, and pleasing to the eye. I also wanted something that would be easy to modify, in order for the portfolio to be able to be updated as my work & academic journey goes on.
